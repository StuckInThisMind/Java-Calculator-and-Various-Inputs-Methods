1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Mean
6. Variance
7. Standard Deviation
8. Power
9. Square Root

Certainly! Below is the description of each function within the provided classes:

### Main Class (`Main.java`)

1. **main()**: 
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It presents a menu for selecting various mathematical operations.
   - Based on the user's choice, it interacts with the `Input` class to receive input data and the `Calculator` class to perform calculations.
   - The program then displays the result of the chosen operation.

### Input Class (`Input.java`)

1. **inputNumbers()**:
   - Prompts the user to input two numbers.
   - Reads and returns these two numbers as an array.

2. **inputArray(int length)**:
   - Prompts the user to input an array of numbers of a specified length.
   - Reads and returns the array of numbers.

### Calculator Class (`Calculator.java`)

1. **addition(double no1, double no2)**:
   - Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

2. **mean(double[] numbers)**:
   - Takes an array of numbers as input and calculates the mean (average) of these numbers.

3. **variance(double[] numbers)**:
   - Takes an array of numbers as input and calculates the variance of these numbers.

4. **std(double[] numbers)**:
   - Takes an array of numbers as input and calculates the standard deviation of these numbers.

5. **substraction(double x, double y)**:
   - Takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.

6. **multiply(double x, double y)**:
   - Takes two numbers as input and returns their product.

7. **division(double x, double y)**:
   - Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. Checks for division by zero.

8. **sqrt(double x)**:
   - Takes a number as input and returns its square root.

9. **power(double x, double y)**:
   - Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second number.

These functions provide the core functionality of the calculator application, allowing users to perform a variety of mathematical operations.


### Usage

1. Select the operation by typing the corresponding number from the menu.
2. Follow the instructions provided by the program to input the required data.
3. The program will display the result of the chosen operation.

### Example

Here's an example of running the program:

1. Addition:
   ```
   Type 1 for Addition 
   Type 2 for Substraction 
   Type 3 for Multiple 
   Type 4 for Division

   Type 8 for Power 
   Type 9 for Square Root
   5
   Enter the number of elements: 4
   Enter Element 1: 10
   Enter Element 2: 20
   Enter Element 3: 30
   Enter Element 4: 40
   The Mean is: 25.0
   ```

3. Variance:
   ```
   Type 1 for Addition 
   Type 2 for Substraction 
   Type 3 for Multiple 
   Type 4 for Division 
   Type 5 for Mean 
   Type 6 for Variance 
   Type 7 for Standard Deviation 
   Type 8 for Power 
   Type 9 for Square Root
   6
   Enter the number of elements: 3
   Enter Element 1: 10
   Enter Element 2: 20
   Enter Element 3: 30
   The Variance is: 66.66666666666667
   ```

### Note

Ensure to provide valid input data, especially for operations like division (avoid division by zero) and square root (avoid negative numbers).
